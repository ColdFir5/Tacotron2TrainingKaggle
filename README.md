# Tacotron 2 Training Kaggle Notebook
This is a notebook from kaggle I had made that allows user's to make their own AI voices using 16bit PCM, 22050 HZ WAV files on the Neural networks provided by NVIDIA's creation of Tacotron 2. I had made this on Kaggle to use their GPU and their CUDA cores in order to successfully make tacotron 2 TTS models.
